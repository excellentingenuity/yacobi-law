The consent and relinquishment must be explained by an attorney or person certified by the Department of Social Services who does not represent the adoptive couple.  The document must be notarized.

                                      She can only withdraw her consent with the Court’s permission.  She would have to prove coercion or duress and that it would be in the best interest of the child for the Court to allow the consent to be withdrawn.  The Court is to consider the totality of the circumstances including emotional stressors in determining whether or not the signing of any consent to adoption was involuntary or pursuant to duress or coercion. See McCann v. Doe, Opinion #26468, filed April 7, 2008. The burden is on the person seeking to revoke the consent to show the consent was obtained involuntarily. Phillips v. Baker, 284 SC 134, 137, 325 SE2d 533, 535 (1985). See S. C. Code Ann. §63-9-350 (Cum. Supp. 1992).<br />

                                      If the birth father is married to the birth mother he may essentially veto any adoption plan. If the birth father was not married to the birth mother and the child is placed before it is six months old and the birth father lived with the birth mother a continuous period of six months immediately preceding the placement and held himself out to be the father during the six month period or paid a fair and reasonable sum, based on his ability, for the support of the child or expenses incurred in connection with the pregnancy or with the birth of the child then his consent will be required and he may essentially veto the adoption plan.  If the birth father was not married to the birth mother and the child is more than six months old at placement, the birth father’s consent is necessary but only if he has maintained substantial and continuous contact or repeated contact with the child as demonstrated by payment of support of a fair and reasonable sum based on his financial ability and visits at least monthly when he is able to do so and not prevented from doing so by the person or agency having lawful custody of the child or regular communication by the father with the child or with the person or agency having custody of the child when the father is financially or physically unable to visit the child or when the father is prevented from visiting the child by the person or agency having lawful custody of the child.

                                      He can have such input as his marital status, interactions with the birth mother and affirmative actions to protect any parental rights might allow.

                                      Effective July 1, 2010, South Carolina’s Responsible Father Registry became operational. There is no cost to register, but only a registrant father may file a claim. The claim must be mailed in and must be filed before the date of a petition for termination of parental rights has been filed and before an adoption petition has been filed. A claim filed after these dates is void. The form must be signed by the registrant father. The registration form is available at the <a href="https://ssl.sc.gov/dssfatherregistry">Social Security Administration</a>.</p>
<p class="para">A birth father who intends to parent the child should timely register with the South Carolina Responsible Father Registry and either live with the child’s mother for six months before the birth of the child and openly hold himself out as the father of the child during this six month period or pay a reasonable sum, based on his ability, for the support of the child or expenses related to the pregnancy or birth, including, but not limited to medical, hospital and nursing expenses. After the child is born, the birth father should maintain substantial and repeated contact with the child by paying support, visiting the child, or communicating with the child or person having lawful custody of the child.</p>

                                                                        <ol id="numbered_list">
                                        	<li>The child or another child in the home has been harmed as defined in Section 63-7-20, and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.  In determining the likelihood that the home can be made safe, the parent’s previous abuse or neglect of the child or another child in the home may be considered;</li>
                                            <li>The child has been removed from the parent pursuant to Section 63-7-620 or Section 63-7-1660 has been out of the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a placement plan by court order or by agreement between the department and the parent, and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal;</li>
                                            <li>The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, during that time the parent has willfully failed to visit the child.  The court may attach little or no weight to incidental visitations, but it must be shown that the parent was not prevented from visiting by the party having custody or by court order.  The distance of the child’s placement from the parent’s home must be taken into consideration when determining the ability to visit;</li>
                                            <li>The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has willfully failed to support the child.  Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to the child’s welfare.  A material contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the parent’s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the parent’s means.  The court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has willfully failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support;</li>

It is presumed that the parent’s condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time upon proof that the parent has been required by the department or the family court to participate in a treatment program for alcohol or drug addiction, and the parent has failed two or more times to complete the program successfully or has refused at two or more separate meetings with the department to participate in a treatment program;</li>
                                            <li>The child has been abandoned as defined in Section 63-7-20;</li>

                                            <li>The physical abuse of a child of the parent resulted in the death or admission to the hospital for in-patient care of that child and the abuse is the act for which the parent has been convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to committing, aiding, abetting, conspiring to commit, or soliciting an offense against the person as provided for in Title 16, Chapter 3, criminal domestic violence as defined in Section 16-25-20, criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature as defined in Section 16-25-65, or the common law offense of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.</li>

The affidavit typically indicates that diligent inquiries have been made at the birth father’s last known address, last known place of employment, attempts made to contact him at all known phone numbers and through all known relatives.  Affidavits also often include language that common known databases have been searched to no avail.</p>

                                  Any South Carolina resident may petition to adopt a child.  Exceptions to the residency requirement are made for a special needs child, if there has been public notoriety concerning the child or child’s family, the child is placed with a relative, if at least one of the adoptive parents is in the military service stationed in South Carolina or if there are unusual or exceptional circumstances such that the best interests of the child would be served by the out of state placements.  See S. C. Code Ann. §63-9-750 (Cum. Supp. 1992).  In practice the “exceptional circumstances” requirement has generally been liberally and expansively interpreted by South Carolina family court judges such that the birth mother’s knowing selection of non-resident adoptive parents will generally be found to meet the “exceptional circumstances” requirement provided any birth mother expenses are reasonable and proper, i.e. there have been no improper incentives for the placement.</p><p class="para">

                                      Adoptive parents must be investigated and approved by a person trained and certified by the Department of Social Services to do home studies.  Criminal histories, child abuse and sex abuse registries are checked.  A <em>guardian ad litem</em> is appointed to protect the interest of the child.  See S. C. Code Ann. §63-9-520 (Cum.

                                      The Complaint for Adoption is filed after the birthmother’s consent has been executed.  However, if the child is to be placed out of state, a Petition for a Finding of Special Circumstances allowing placement with a nonresident be filed before the birth of the child.</p>
<p class="para"><u>Note:</u> The passage of the “Responsible Father Registry Statue” gives legal counsel representing the adoptive parents significant reasons to file the Complaint for Adoption as soon as possible after the placement as a delay in filing the Petition or Complaint will give any possible birth father an expanded window of time to register with the Responsible Father Registry.

                                      A.	No.  Any non-licensed facilitator or non-licensed child-placing agency that attempts to receive a fee to match adoptive families with birth families would likely run afoul of South Carolina Code Sections 16-3-1060 and 63-9-310.  Violating the provisions of these sections is a felony and carries sanctions of up to ten (10) years in prison and fines of up to $10,000.00 or both.</p>
                                       <p class="para">Moreover, Section 63-9-70 precludes child-placing agencies not licensed in the State of South Carolina from advertising that the person or entity will place or accept a child for adoption and persons violating that section may be fined or imprisoned or both.</p><br />

                                      Independent adoptions typically match adoptive families with a particular birth mother and the adoptive parents bear all of the costs and risks associated with a particular birth mother.</p>
                                       <p class="para">Many agency adoptions proceed on a flat fee basis and allowable birth mother expenses for a particular birth mother are not passed through directly to the adoptive parents.</p><br />

                                      The file will be kept confidential except upon court order for good cause shown by order of the judge of the court in which the decree of adoption was entered. See § 63-9-780.</p>
                                       <p class="para">The court will weigh the privacy rights of the natural parents against the interests of the adopted child to determine whether or not good cause has been shown.  A basic desire of the adoptee to know their identity has been found to be insufficient.  <u>Bradley v. Children’s Bureau of South Carolina</u>, 274 SE2d 418 (1981).  There must be a compelling reason for such information to be revealed.  <u>Gardner v. Baby Edwards</u>, 342 SE2d 601 (1986).</p><br />
